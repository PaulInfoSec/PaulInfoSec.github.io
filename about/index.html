			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I fell in love with Information Security almost 10 years ago, I was working in an IT operations role at the time and was asked to participate in a post targetted attack simulation (Red Team) debrief presentation. In the debrief session I learned about Cyber Kill chains and the art of lateral movement and instantly I was hooked. Since then I have completed a Masters of Science MSc in Cyber Security and passed the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) certification, I currently work as a Cyber Security Manager in the Financial services sector. I am an aspiring Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and my current area of interest and focus are application security and DevSecOps  </p>
